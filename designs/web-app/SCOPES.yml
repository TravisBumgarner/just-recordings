    title: Set up monorepo with npm workspaces
    description: |
      Initialize the monorepo structure with npm workspaces for managing the

    acceptance_criteria:
      - Root package.json with npm workspaces configuration pointing to packages/*
      - Shared tsconfig.base.json with common TypeScript settings (strict mode, ES2022 target)
      - .gitignore with Node.js defaults (node_modules, dist, .env)
      - Root scripts for dev, build, and test that run across all packages

    title: Configure concurrent development scripts
    description: |
      Set up development scripts that run both frontend and backend
      concurrently for local development with proper proxying.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Install concurrently in root package
      - Root npm run dev starts both web and api in parallel
      - Vite dev server proxies /api requests to backend port 3001
