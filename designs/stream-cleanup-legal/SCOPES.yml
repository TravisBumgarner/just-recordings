  # Bug Fix

    milestone: 53
    title: Release acquired screen stream when desktop app window is hidden/closed
    description: |
      When the desktop app window is hidden (on blur) or closed, any pre-acquired
      screen stream should be released. Currently if a user starts the recording
      flow but the window hides during countdown, the stream remains active.

      The fix should add cleanup logic in useRecordingFlow.ts to release the
      acquiredScreenRef stream on component unmount or when receiving a signal
      that the window is being hidden.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Pre-acquired screen stream is released when desktop app window is hidden
      - Pre-acquired screen stream is released when desktop app is closed/quit
      - Stream cleanup does not interfere with active recordings
      - No memory leaks from unreleased streams
