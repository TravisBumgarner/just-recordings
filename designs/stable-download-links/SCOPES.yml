    title: Add download routes and external links constants to ROUTES
    description: |
      Add download-related routes and external link constants to the ROUTES configuration
      in `consts.ts`. This provides a centralized location for all download URLs.

      Add to `packages/web/src/consts.ts`:
      - `downloads` route for the downloads page (`/downloads`)
      - `EXTERNAL_LINKS` constant with GitHub release URLs for each platform

      The external links should use GitHub's stable "latest" release URL pattern:
      `https://github.com/TravisBumgarner/just-recordings/releases/latest/download/{filename}`

      File names from electron-forge config:
      - Windows: `Just-Recordings-win32-x64-setup.exe`
      - macOS: `Just-Recordings-darwin.dmg`
      - Linux: `just-recordings_0.0.2_amd64.deb`

      Files to modify:
      - packages/web/src/consts.ts
    acceptance_criteria:
      - ROUTES.downloads added with key, href, and label
      - EXTERNAL_LINKS constant exported with windows, mac, and linux URLs
      - URLs use GitHub's stable "latest" release pattern
