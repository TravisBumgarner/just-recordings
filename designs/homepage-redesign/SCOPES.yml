    title: Homepage video grid with thumbnails and upload queue
    description: |
      Transform the web app homepage into a dashboard showing a grid of recorded
      videos with thumbnails. Add upload queue display above the grid and reposition
      the Start Recording button to the top right corner.

      Backend changes:
      - Add thumbnailPath to RecordingMetadata interface in both packages
      - Implement thumbnail generation during upload finalization using ffmpeg
      - Add GET /api/recordings/:id/thumbnail endpoint
      - Delete thumbnail when recording is deleted

      Frontend changes:
      - Redesign Home.tsx with video grid showing thumbnails
      - Position Start Recording button in top right corner
      - Display upload queue as list above video grid
      - Pass uploadManager prop from App.tsx to Home component
    acceptance_criteria:
      - thumbnailPath field added to RecordingMetadata in API and web packages
      - Thumbnail generated from first frame during upload finalization (failure doesn't block upload)
      - GET /api/recordings/:id/thumbnail serves thumbnail image (404 if missing)
      - Thumbnail file deleted when recording is deleted
      - Homepage displays recordings in responsive grid with thumbnails (placeholder fallback)
      - Start Recording button positioned in top right corner
      - Upload queue displayed above grid when items exist (with status, progress, retry/cancel)
      - Unit tests for backend endpoints and frontend components
