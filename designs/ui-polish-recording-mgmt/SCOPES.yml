    title: Unify recording controls with icon buttons (web and desktop)
    description: |
      Unify the recording control buttons between web (RecordingControlsModal) and desktop
      (FloatingControlsContent) to use the same icon-based UI. Both should have: Stop,
      Pause/Resume, Restart, and Cancel buttons using react-icons.

      Currently:
      - Desktop FloatingControlsContent: Uses icon buttons (FaStop, FaPause, FaPlay, FaTimes)
        but is missing Restart
      - Web RecordingControlsModal: Uses text-based buttons with full words

      Update RecordingControlsModal to use the same icon-button pattern as FloatingControlsContent,
      and add a Restart button to FloatingControlsContent.

      Files to modify:
      - packages/web/src/components/RecordingControlsModal.tsx
      - packages/web/src/components/FloatingControlsContent.tsx
      - packages/web/src/__tests__/RecordingControlsModal.test.tsx
      - packages/web/src/__tests__/FloatingControlsContent.test.tsx
    acceptance_criteria:
      - RecordingControlsModal uses IconButton components with react-icons (FaStop, FaPause, FaPlay, FaRedo, FaTimes)
      - FloatingControlsContent includes a Restart button with FaRedo icon
      - Both components have tooltips on buttons showing the action name
      - Confirmation dialogs for Restart and Cancel work on both platforms

    title: Fix upload chunk size to meet Cloudinary 5MB minimum
    description: |
      Fix the "All parts except EOF-chunk must be larger than 5mb" error from Cloudinary
      uploads by increasing the chunk size from 1MB to 6MB.

      Current issue:
      - chunkBlob.ts uses DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE = 1MB
      - CloudinaryUploader.ts uses CLOUDINARY_CHUNK_SIZE = 6MB for uploads
      - The mismatch causes non-final chunks to be under 5MB, violating Cloudinary's
        chunked upload requirements

      Fix: Update DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE in chunkBlob.ts to 6MB (6 * 1024 * 1024).

      Files to modify:
      - packages/recorder/src/uploader/chunkBlob.ts
    acceptance_criteria:
      - DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE in chunkBlob.ts is increased to 6MB (6 * 1024 * 1024)
      - Tests updated to reflect new chunk size behavior

      - packages/api/src/db/queries/recordings.ts (add updateRecording query)
      - packages/shared/src/api/recordings.ts (add UpdateRecordingRequest type)

      - PATCH /api/recordings/:id endpoint accepts { name: string }
      - Endpoint returns 403 if user doesn't own the recording
      - Endpoint returns 404 if recording doesn't exist
      - Endpoint returns updated recording on success
      - Shared types exported for request/response

      - Enter key or Save button saves the new name
      - Escape key or Cancel button reverts changes
      - Loading state shown during save
      - React Query cache updated optimistically
