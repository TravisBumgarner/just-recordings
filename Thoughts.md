Write me a React web app using TypeScript, MaterialUI, Vite. Hook it up to an express backend.
Write me a separate Electron react, typescript, material ui, vite app that also hooks to backend. 
Write me a minimal video/screen recorder that will live alone but that both the Electron app and React app can import and use.
